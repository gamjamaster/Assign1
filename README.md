## Functionality
This project implements and compares 4 search algorithms: Sequential Search, Binary Search, Jump Search, Finonacci Search.
The program generates 30 elements to search where 80% exists in the dataset and 20% do not.
Each algorithm is raced using multithreading and the numbe of operations to search for each element is counted.
Finally, the average number of operations for every algorithm is calculated and displayed on a graph together with the time complexities of each algorithm.

## Instructions to Run
Option 1: Open the project on an IDE and click on compile and run.
Option 2: Complie and run every source code from terminal.
